Sometimes it is too large for browser to displays the html page.So I provide this index.html,as long as you put it 
in your browser to display it,one 5 page html will display well.

Also I push it to the web "http://rpubs.com/IronWolf/Developing_Data_Products_Part2" ,
but sometimes I think this page is too larger for browser to display it.

The project use slidify to generated,and I give the rpubs "http://rpubs.com/IronWolf/Developing_Data_Products_Part2"
as well,in order to prevent it can't displays well in your computer.Now if this thing happen,you can open "index.html" 
in your Chrome browser and it will display clearly.

Please forgive me,best wishes to you.
